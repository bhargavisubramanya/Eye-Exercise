# Eye-Exercise
This page has a pair of eyes whose eyeballs follow the mouse movement. One of the first exercises that combined the skills of javascript and css to bring about this cool web page. 

**HOW TO USE?**

Download all files and drop the html file on your browser to see it in action!


A cool feature to add to this would be a mouth which would open and close when the mouse hovers on it.
