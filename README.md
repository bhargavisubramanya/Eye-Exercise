# Eye-Exercise
This page has a pair of eyes whose eyeballs follow the mouse movement. One of the first exercises that combined the skills of javascript and css to bring about this cool web page. 
Download all files and drop the html file on your browser to see it in action!
A cool feature to add to this would be a mouth which would open and close when the mouse hovers on it.
